Determines the overlay text. Leave blank to disable the overlay text. You can use the following replacement tokens: {snapshot_number}, {current_time}, {time_elapsed}, {layer}, {height}, {x}, {y}, {z}, {e}

Note that x, y, z, and e are all in absolute coordinates.  All floating point values will display with three decimals except for e, which will show 5.

If you'd like to see a replacement token that is not listed, please create an issue on the [octolapse repository](https://github.com/FormerLurker/Octolapse/issues) to suggest more options.
