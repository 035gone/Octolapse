When using the 'High Quality' smart trigger, this option will allow Octolapse to choose to reduce travel versus choosing a higher quality position, but ONLY if it reduces travel distance by at least the percentage entered here.  This can speed up your print when compared to the 'Best Quality' smart trigger type while providing higher quality than the 'Normal Quality' smart trigger type.

See the 'Smart Layer Trigger Type' help for more information.
