Test mode can be used to try out timelapse settings without printing anything. Test mode must be activated BEFORE starting a print. Changing this setting mid-print won't alter any current prints.

Before starting test mode, UNLOAD YOUR FILAMENT! Even though I attempted to strip all extruder commands, there's a chance that I missed some cases. Please let me know if you see any 'cold extrusion prevented' errors in the terminal window. If you do, please send me your GCode!

NEVER print with your printer unattended, and that includes running Octolapse in test mode.  After starting a test mode print, make sure your extruder and build plate do not warm up, and that your extruder isn't moving.  If your build plate or extruder warms up, or if your extruder gear is turning with test mode enabled, DISCONTINUE THE PRINT and please report the problem in the Octolapse github issues page.
