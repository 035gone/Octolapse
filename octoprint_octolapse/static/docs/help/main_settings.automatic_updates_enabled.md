Enable or disable automatic profile updates.  Currently only printer profiles have automatic capabilities.  When this setting is enabled, printer profiles will be updated when they meet the following criteria:

1.  Make and model needs to be selected.  Selecting 'Other' will prevent automatic updates.
2.  The printer profile needs to have automatic updates enabled as well.

Automatic printer profile updates will not affect your slicer settings.
