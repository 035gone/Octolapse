Prevents the extruder from leaving the print during stabilization, reducing travel movements to 0.  This is a great option for improving print quality and reducing the amount of time Octolapse adds to your print, and is especially useful for vase mode.  However, your timelapse will likely be a little jerky depending on the shape of your printed part.

Note:  You might consider using snap-to-print with the stabilization profile set to 'Disabled', which has the interesting effect of causing the extruder to (usually) smoothly wander around the print.  This is a great combo for vase mode.
