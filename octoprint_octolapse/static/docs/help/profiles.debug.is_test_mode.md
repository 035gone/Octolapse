Test mode can be used to try out timelapse settings without printing anything. Test mode must be activated BEFORE starting a print. Changing this setting mid-print won't alter any current prints.

1.  Navigate to the Debug tab and select 'Test Mode'. Note: You shouldn't have to use any of the profiles marked 'Diagnostic' unless you suspect a bug.
2.  UNLOAD YOUR FILAMENT! Even though I attempted to strip all extruder commands, there's a chance that I missed some cases. Please let me know if you see any 'cold extrusion prevented' errors in the terminal window. If you do, please send me your GCode!
3.  Select a local GCode file and click print.

Notes: Pay attention to your printer temps during the test print. Everything should remain cool! If not, please let me know, send me the GCode, and I'll try to remedy the situation. See the known issues for details.
