If you have enabled **Archive Snapshots After Rendering** within the **Files and Performance** heading of your **Rendering** profile, archives of your timelapse images and settings will appear within the file browser located on this tab after rendering has completed successfully.  You can download, delete, or render any archives, or you can import new archive files (see the **Import Snapshot Archive (.zip)** help icon for more details about importing archives).

### Downloading Archives
Simply click the <i class="fa fa-download" title="Download Icon"></i> icon to download an archive.

### Deleting Archives
You can delete an archive by clicking the <i class="fa fa-delete" title="Delete Icon"></i> icon, or by selecting one or more archives and clicking the **Delete** button above the selection column.

### Add Archives to Unfinished Renderings
By clicking the <i class="fa fa-film" title="Film Icon"></i> icon you can add any archive to the unfinished rendering list.  You can access this list by closing the **Videos and Images** dialog, and clicking on the red **Unfinished Renderings** button.  From there you will be able to change settings and render a timelapse video from your archive.

Note:  Adding archives to the unfinished rendering list will take up at least as much disk space as the size of the archive.  Make sure you have plenty of free disk space before adding archives to the unfinished renderings and before initiating video rendering.
