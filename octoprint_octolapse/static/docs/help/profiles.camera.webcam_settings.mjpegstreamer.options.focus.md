If Autofocus is NOT enabled, you can manually set the focus here.  I recommend starting by increasing the focus by units of 5 at first, then reversing direction when the image becomes worse, moving by 1 unit at a time until you either find the best value, or you can't tell a difference anymore.  It helps to put book or something else with printed text EXACTLY where your print will be.  It is much easier to adjust the focus when there is sharp text at the focal point.
