### Slicer Type
Octolapse will be easier to configure if you select the slicer you are using.  You have the following options:

* Automatic Configuration
* Cura
* Slic3r Prusa Edition
* Simplify 3D
* Other Slicer (generic slicer)
#### Automatic Configuration
Octolapse will attempt to automatically extract your slicer settings.  This should work out of the box for Slic3r PE, Prusa Slicer, and Simplify 3D.  If you are using Cura, you will need to insert a settings template into your start or end gcode.
