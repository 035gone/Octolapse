Select the font that will be used to generate an overlay in your timelapse.

IMPORTANT NOTE:  If you are using OctoPi, or any flavor of Linux, you need Fontconfig installed so that Octolapse can find your system fonts.

To install fontconfig:

1. connect to a terminal screen and sign in.
2. run the following command to update any existing applications:
```
sudo apt-get update
```
3. install fontconfig with the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install fontconfig
```
4. reboot your system for the changes to take effect.
