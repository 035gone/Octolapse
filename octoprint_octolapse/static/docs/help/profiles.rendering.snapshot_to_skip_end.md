This setting can be used to remove frames from the end of the timelapse.  This can be useful in many situations.  For example, if Octolapse is taking a snapshot after the print is finished, and you won't want that frame to be in the final timelapse, you can remove it by setting this value to 1.  

Set to 0 to disable.

Note that Octolapse will still take a snapshot for any removed frames, but they will not be rendered into the final timelapse.

Also, the last available frame that is NOT removed will be used for the pre-roll frame, if you are adding pre-roll.
